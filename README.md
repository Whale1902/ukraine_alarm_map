In order to attempt to build it yourself, you'll need to get your API key (check the website above). For me, it took four and a half months of waiting for my key.

I've ordered it map designin and printing at https://www.3dprinter.ua/ 
It took somewhere about three months to arrive and cost somewhere about $100. Front white plate made out of acrylic sheet.

P.S. I am a beginner level programmer, so there will be a lot of inefficient decisions. Feel free to push if you have any idea of how to make it work better.  
P.P.S I am  not as good at English as well, so please pardon me my mistakes.
