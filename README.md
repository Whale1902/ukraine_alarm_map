In order to attempt, you'll need to get your API key (check the website above). For me, it took four and a half months of waiting for my key, but it worth it.

Speaking of actual map, I've ordered it design and print at https://www.3dprinter.ua/ Designing and printing took somewhere about three months and costs for me somewhere about $100. [So I'm attaching printing file]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1de5a5DaVkXC3PaO3RGPNZgDLjzytU1BL/view?usp=sharing)).

P.S. I am a beginner level programmer, so there will be a lot of inefficient decisions. Feel free to commit if you have any idea of how to make work it better.  
P.P.S I am  not as good at English as well, so pardon my mistakes.
